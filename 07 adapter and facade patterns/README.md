# ðŸš€ Welcome to Command adapter and facade patterns!

## the Adapter Design Pattern 
# Purpose: The Adapter pattern helps in converting the interface of one class into another interface expected by the client.
# When to Use: When you want to use an existing class but its interface does not match the system's requirements.
# Benefits: Reusability, flexibility, and easier integration of legacy systems.
